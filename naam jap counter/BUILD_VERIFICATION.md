# Build Verification for Divine Chant Tracker

## Purpose

This document outlines the steps to verify that the Divine Chant Tracker application will build successfully when deployed to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js 18+ installed
2. npm or yarn package manager
3. Git repository with all code committed

## Verification Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This command should complete without errors and create a `node_modules` directory.

### 2. Run TypeScript Compilation

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

This command checks for TypeScript errors without generating output files.

### 3. Run Build Command

```bash
npm run build
```

This command should complete successfully and generate a `.next` directory with the built application.

### 4. Verify Build Output

After a successful build, check that the following exist:
- `.next` directory
- Static assets in `.next/static/`
- Server-side rendered pages
- API routes compiled correctly

### 5. Test Production Build

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the production server. You should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000

## Common Build Issues and Solutions

### 1. Missing Dependencies
If the build fails due to missing modules:
```bash
npm install [missing-module]
```

### 2. TypeScript Errors
Fix any TypeScript errors reported during compilation.

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set or have default values.

### 4. Path Issues
Verify all import paths are correct and files exist.

## Vercel-Specific Considerations

### 1. Build Environment
Vercel uses:
- Node.js version specified in package.json or default
- Linux build environment
- 15-minute build timeout

### 2. Runtime Environment
- Serverless functions have 10-second execution timeout
- 50MB deployment size limit
- Cold start for serverless functions

### 3. Optimization
- Automatic static optimization for pages
- Server-side rendering for dynamic pages
- API routes as serverless functions

## Success Criteria

A successful build must:
1. Complete without errors
2. Generate a `.next` directory
3. Pass all TypeScript checks
4. Serve the application correctly with `npm start`

## Additional Verification

### 1. Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

### 2. Test Routes
- `/` (Homepage)
- `/reports` (Reports page)
- `/goals` (Goals page)
- `/settings` (Settings page)
- `/api/health` (Health check API)
- `/api/recitations` (Recitations API)

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check for TypeScript errors
4. Ensure environment variables are properly configured
5. Review Vercel documentation for specific error codes

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify repository access
3. Check environment variable configuration
4. Ensure build command is correct

## Conclusion

Following these verification steps will ensure that the Divine Chant Tracker application builds successfully and is ready for deployment on Vercel. The application is structured according to Next.js best practices and should deploy without issues when all prerequisites are met.
