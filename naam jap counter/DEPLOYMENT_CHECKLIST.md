3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your Git repository

### 2. Configure Project
1. Framework: Next.js
2. Build Command: `npm run build`
3. Output Directory: `.next`
4. Root Directory: Leave as is (root of repository)

### 3. Environment Variables
Add the following environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Your JWT secret key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

### 4. Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait for the build to complete
3. Visit your deployed application

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Voice recognition functionality accessible
- [ ] All pages load without errors

### 2. API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/health` returns success response
- [ ] `/api/recitations` returns data
- [ ] All API routes are accessible

### 3. Database Integration
- [ ] Database connection is successful
- [ ] Data can be read from database
- [ ] Data can be written to database

### 4. Environment Variables
- [ ] All environment variables are properly loaded
- [ ] No missing configuration errors

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Build Failures
- Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify TypeScript compilation

### 2. Runtime Errors
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check API route responses

### 3. Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL format
- Check database credentials
- Ensure database allows connections from Vercel

### 4. Voice Recognition Issues

3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
4. Wait for SSL certificate to be provisioned

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Vercel Analytics
- Performance metrics
- Visitor statistics
- Error tracking

### Custom Monitoring
- Implement logging for API routes
- Add error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up performance monitoring

## Security Considerations
